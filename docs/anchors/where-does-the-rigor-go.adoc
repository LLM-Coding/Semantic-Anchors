Also known as:: Test Rigor Question, Where to Test Question

*Core Concepts*:

Test rigor placement:: Critical question about where in the test suite the most thorough validation occurs

Ice cream cone problem:: Anti-pattern where most testing rigor is in slow, brittle E2E tests instead of fast unit tests

Inverted pyramid consequences:: When testing rigor is concentrated at the top (UI/E2E layer), feedback is slow and maintenance is expensive

Strategic rigor distribution:: Consciously deciding which test layers should carry the bulk of verification responsibility

Cost of rigor misplacement:: High maintenance burden, slow feedback loops, and brittle test suites when rigor is in wrong layer

Rigor vs coverage tradeoff:: Understanding that thoroughness (rigor) should increase at lower test levels, not upper levels

Test confidence engineering:: Deliberately engineering where confidence comes from in the test suite


Key Proponent:: Alister Scott and the software testing community, addressing the Ice Cream Cone anti-pattern

*When to Use*:

* Auditing existing test suites to identify where rigor is concentrated
* Planning test strategy for new projects
* Debugging why tests are slow or brittle
* Coaching teams on test pyramid principles
* Evaluating test suite health and effectiveness
* Deciding test coverage strategy across layers
* Addressing maintenance burden in test suites
