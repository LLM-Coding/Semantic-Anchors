Full Name:: Pugh Decision Matrix (also Pugh Controlled Convergence)

[discrete]
== *Core Concepts*:

Matrix layout:: Criteria as ROWS, alternatives as COLUMNS
Reference (baseline):: One alternative is designated as reference — scored entirely as 0/S
Relative scoring:: Each alternative rated against the reference: Better (+), Same (S), Worse (−)
Summary rows:: Σ(+), Σ(−), Σ(S), and Net Score per alternative at bottom of matrix
Structured evaluation:: Systematic comparison across multiple dimensions
Team decision-making:: Facilitates group consensus
Hybrid solutions:: Combine strengths of different alternatives
Iterative refinement:: Multiple rounds to converge on best solution

Key Proponent:: Stuart Pugh ("Total Design", 1991)

== *Variants* (use as qualifier for consistent results):

Unweighted 3-Point Pugh Matrix:: Original form. Default when no qualifier is given.
Weighted 3-Point Pugh Matrix:: Criteria carry importance weights. Standard in Six Sigma / QFD contexts.
Weighted 5-Point Pugh Matrix:: Finer granularity for closely ranked alternatives.
Pugh Controlled Convergence:: Iterative multi-round process with elimination, hybrid creation, and reference rotation.

[discrete]
== *When to Use*:

* Multiple viable alternatives exist
* Decision criteria are known but trade-offs are unclear
* Team needs to reach consensus
* Architecture or technology selection decisions
