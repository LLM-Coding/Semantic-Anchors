Full Name:: MoSCoW Prioritization Method

Also known as:: MoSCoW Analysis, MoSCoW Method

[discrete]
== *Core Concepts*:

MoSCoW = **M**ust have / **S**hould have / **C**ould have / **W**on't have

Must have:: Non-negotiable requirements essential for the current delivery; without them the solution is unusable or unsafe

Should have:: Important requirements that are not vital; painful to leave out but the solution is still viable without them

Could have:: Desirable but not necessary requirements; included only if time and resources permit

Won't have (this time):: Requirements explicitly agreed to be out of scope for the current iteration; may be reconsidered in future

Timeboxed context:: Prioritization is always relative to a fixed timebox, not permanent

Stakeholder alignment:: Prioritization is a collaborative activity that builds shared understanding

Scope control:: Explicit "Won't have" category reduces scope creep by surfacing deferred items


Key Proponent:: Dai Clegg (Dynamic Systems Development Method / DSDM, 1994)
