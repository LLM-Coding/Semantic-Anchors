Also known as:: Compliance Environment, Validated Environment, Regulated Industry Development

== *Core Concepts*:

Traceability:: Every requirement, design decision, implementation, and test must be linked end-to-end; changes traceable from origin to deployment

Validation & Verification (V&V):: Formal proof that a system does what it is intended to do (validation) and is built correctly (verification)

Audit Trail:: Immutable, timestamped record of who changed what, when, and why; essential for regulatory inspections

Change Control:: Formal process for evaluating, approving, implementing, and documenting any change to a validated system

Documentation requirements:: Specifications (URS, FS, DS), SOPs, test protocols, validation reports, and risk assessments are mandatory deliverables

Risk-based approach:: Effort and rigor proportional to the risk posed by the system (e.g., GAMP 5 categories, FMEA)

Separation of environments:: Strict segregation of development, testing/qualification, and production environments

Reproducibility:: Builds, deployments, and test results must be reproducible; version-pinned dependencies and infrastructure-as-code

Electronic signatures & records:: Legally binding digital sign-off on documents and data (e.g., FDA 21 CFR Part 11)

Supplier qualification:: Third-party components and vendors must be qualified and audited

== *Applicable Standards & Frameworks*:

* *FDA 21 CFR Part 11* – Electronic records and signatures (US pharmaceutical/medical)
* *EU GMP Annex 11* – Computerised systems in pharmaceutical manufacturing
* *GAMP 5* – Good Automated Manufacturing Practice (risk-based validation guidance)
* *ISO 9001* – Quality management systems
* *IEC 62304* – Medical device software lifecycle
* *ISO 26262* – Functional safety for automotive systems
* *SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)* – Financial reporting systems (IT general controls)
* *ISO/IEC 27001* – Information security management

[discrete]
== *When to Use*:

* Developing software for pharmaceutical, biotech, or medical device industries
* Building systems subject to FDA, EMA, or other regulatory body oversight
* Any project where an audit by an external authority is anticipated
* Financial systems subject to SOX, PCI-DSS, or similar controls
* Safety-critical systems in automotive, aerospace, or industrial automation
* Setting up CI/CD pipelines that must satisfy validation requirements
