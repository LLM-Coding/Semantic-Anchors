Also known as:: Distributed Monolith Anti-Pattern

[discrete]
== *Core Concepts*:

Three coupling types:: The simultaneous presence of all three creates a particularly fragile and unmaintainable system:

Temporal coupling:: Services communicate synchronously, causing cascading failures when one service is slow or unavailable

Behavioral coupling:: Services know too much about each other's internal logic, making independent evolution impossible

Data coupling:: Services share a database or data model, preventing independent deployment and scaling

The Distributed Monolith:: The result of the trifecta — a system with all the operational complexity of microservices but none of their independence benefits

Anti-pattern nature:: Each coupling type is manageable in isolation; the danger is their combination

Failure cascades:: Synchronous calls across shared data with shared logic create chain reactions that bring down entire systems


Key Proponent:: Joy Heron (InnoQ)

== *When to Use*:

* Evaluating whether a microservice architecture is actually a distributed monolith
* Identifying root causes of deployment bottlenecks in service-oriented systems
* Guiding architectural refactoring to break problematic coupling
* Reviewing microservice decomposition strategies
* Diagnosing why a supposedly independent service causes widespread failures
