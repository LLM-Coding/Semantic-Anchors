Full Name:: Grundsätze ordnungsmäßiger Modellierung (Principles of Proper Modeling)

Also known as:: GoM Principles, Principles of Well-formed Modeling

[discrete]
== *Core Concepts*:

Correctness (Richtigkeit):: The model must accurately reflect the reality it represents — both syntactically (follows notation rules) and semantically (describes the real subject matter truthfully)

Relevance (Relevanz):: A model should include only elements that are relevant to the intended purpose; unnecessary details reduce usability

Economic Efficiency (Wirtschaftlichkeit):: The benefit gained from a model must justify the effort and cost of creating and maintaining it

Clarity (Klarheit):: The model must be understandable to its intended audience; layout, notation, and level of detail must support comprehension

Comparability (Vergleichbarkeit):: Models of the same subject should follow consistent conventions so they can be meaningfully compared

Systematic Design (Systematischer Aufbau):: Models should be constructed using a consistent, structured approach to enable reuse and integration across a model landscape


Key Proponents:: Jörg Becker, Michael Rosemann, Rolf Schütte ("Grundsätze ordnungsmäßiger Modellierung", WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK, 1995)

== *When to Use*:

* Evaluating or reviewing the quality of business process models (BPMN, EPC)
* Establishing modeling standards within an organization or project
* Enterprise architecture modeling to ensure consistent, reusable model artifacts
* ERP implementation projects requiring traceable and auditable process documentation
* Assessing whether a model is fit for its intended purpose
* Onboarding teams to structured modeling practices
